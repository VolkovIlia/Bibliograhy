lectivity toward the 2e ORR instead, and concluded that isolated Pt single atoms cannot effectively break the O‚îÄO bond and therefore exhibit poor selectivity toward the 4e ORR process due to the absence of Pt‚ÄìPt ensemble sites.[7,13,17] Currently, most of the Pt SACs rely on the strategy of having large-surface-area support materials coupled with relatively minute loadings of Pt to realize a stable dispersion of the single atoms. Therefore, the active Pt atoms are far isolated from their neighboring sites and assumed to have negligible interaction. Various attempts to study and tune the energy barrier and reaction pathways so far have focused on examining and tailoring the local coordination environment at the exact sites of the active centers, but only very few studies have expanded the exploration to involve synergistic interactions among the neighboring active sites.[10,18] In view of the above-mentioned challenges and the large unfilled gap, it would be worth examining the interactions between closely spaced and yet non-contiguous single atoms, to exploit their synergy in enhancing the intrinsic activity and selectivity of heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Molybdenum carbides are promising support materials for anchoring Pt single atoms, owing to the especially strong metal‚Äì support interaction, and importantly their ability to anchor Pt single atoms in a wide concentration range thus allowing the modeling of potential synergistic interactions among the densely populated Pt single atoms without compromising the dispersion and stability.[19‚Äì21] Herein, by taking ORR as a model reaction, and atomically dispersed Pt supported on a mesoporous orthorhombic molybdenum carbide (ùõΩ-Mo2C) substrate as a model catalyst, we examine the evolution of the ORR activity and mechanism with reference to the degree of separation between the neighboring Pt atoms by both experimental and computational studies. Catalysts with various Pt loadings were synthesized and their application in ORR was investigated. We observed a distinct switch in mass activity and selectivity being when the Pt loading was increased while the single atom dispersion was still maintained; we term this case the ‚Äúquasi-paired single atoms‚Äù in that two closely neighboring and yet non-contiguous Pt sites exhibit synergistic interactions while remaining ‚Äúsingle‚Äù (not directly bonded). The catalyst with quasi-paired Pt single atoms demonstrates superior 4e ORR activity and selectivity as compared to its far isolated single atomic counterpart, exemplifying an optimum balance between single atom dispersion and synergy. By density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we further investigated the effect of mean Pt‚ÄìPt distance on the binding modes of reaction intermediates, and the theoretical Table 1. Denotation and description of Pt/Mo2C samples with respective Pt loadings (measured by ICP-OES).

Synthesis and Characterization of Catalyst Materials As illustrated in Figure 1a, during the synthesis, a Mo/Zn bimetallic imidazole framework (Mo/Zn BIF) is first formed as a precursor, and is then converted into Mo2C by heat treatment in a reducing atmosphere at 800 ¬∞C, during which Zn vaporizes, leaving behind a mesoporous structure as the catalyst support, which was reported in our previous work.[22] With the incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) method, Pt/Mo2C samples with different mean Pt‚ÄìPt distances are synthesized by controlling the Pt mass loading, and the Pt contents are confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). As a result, the samples with isolated Pt single atoms (Ptiso/Mo2C), quasi-paired Pt single atoms (Ptquasi/Mo2C), and Pt nanoparticles with contiguous Pt sites (PtNP/Mo2C) are obtained for comparison investigations, and their Pt mass loadings are summarized in Table 1. The Mo/Zn BIF precursor exhibits a flower-like morphology

Pt peaks, @zhang_yang2021  indicating the absence of crystalline Pt phase, which suggests that the Pt could be atomically dispersed on Mo2C without agglomerating into larger nanocrystals. For the Pt nanoparticle sample (PtNP/Mo2C), small Pt peaks become discernible at the 2ùúÉ angles of 46.54¬∞ and 67.86¬∞, indicating the appearance of crystalline Pt phase (when the Pt loading is increased by nearly fivefold to 11.18 wt%). 3. Atomic-Scale Visualization and Structure Analysis The existence of Pt single atoms in Ptiso/Mo2C and Ptquasi/Mo2C is further confirmed by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HADDF-STEM). As shown in Figure 2a,b, Pt single atoms can be distinguished on Mo2C substrate as bright dots scattered on the lattice of Mo2C (some examples of Pt atoms are indicated by pink circles), which shows no aggregation and proves the ability of the mesoporous Mo2C support to stabilize the Pt single atoms. The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) in Figure 2b shows only the characteristics of Mo2C, with no indication of any Pt crystal structure, which agrees with the atomic dispersion of Pt. In Ptiso/Mo2C, the Pt single atoms are scattered farther apart and are isolated from one another, while in Ptquasi/Mo2C (of which the magnified views of three selected regions are exhibited in Figure 2b 1‚Äìb3),
