Supported gold catalysts have drawn tremendous attention in research [1,2], since the breakthrough of the extremely high activity of that in catalyzing CO oxidation at low temperature by Haruta and co-workers in the 1980s [3]. Recently, plenty of researches have been focused on the source of the remarkable catalytic behavior from supported gold catalysts [4–8]. There are three important factors shown significant influence for the reactivity of supported gold catalysts during catalyzing CO oxidation, the components and size of gold species [7,9], the properties of support material [10,11], as well as the interaction between metal and support [12,13]. Despite of the deep study on the factors which influence the reactivity of supported gold catalysts, there are still controversies because of the complexity of the catalytic system.
