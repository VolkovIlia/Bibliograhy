Recently, global warming has become a serious problem affecting humanity due to a rapid increase of CO2 emission which has consequently led to an increase in the average global temperature [1]. Therefore, various techniques have been proposed to reduce the atmospheric CO2 accumulation, for example: carbon capture and storage (CCS) [2–4] that aims to capture and store large quantities of CO2, and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) [5–7] that aims to convert CO2 to fuels such as dimethyl ether (DME) dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and methanol (MeOH) [8–13]. Especially for the production in the latter case, DME, DMC, and MeOH are key feedstock for industrial chemicals, which can be converted into high molecular weight hydrocarbons and alternative fuels, where the CO2 hydrogenation process is one of the most efficient and economical routes for CO2 emission utilization [14–20]. However, the hydrogenation reaction is highly exothermic and it is difficult to activate CO2 owing to its high stability [21,22]. Therefore, catalysts are employed to reduce the activation energy of the hydrogenation step and break the CO2 bonds [23,24]. Cu-Zn oxide-based catalysts have been widely reported for the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol process [25–30]. The role of Zn oxide is to improve the dispersion of metallic copper particles. Additionally, it has been found that Zn oxide exhibits an active site for hydrogen spillover. Moreover, the interaction between Cu and Zn oxide causes an electron transfer from Zn oxide to Cu metal that occurs as Cu0 and Cu+ species, which are crucial for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [31–36]. It has been confirmed by other studies that copper metal alone cannot be the sole active site for higher activities in methanol synthesis [37,38]. While Cu-Zn oxide-based catalysts have been well-researched for methanol synthesis, these catalysts are not prevalent because the metals have low active surface area and are prone to sintering. Hence, catalyst supports are used as a metal receptor to increase surface area and improve metal dispersion [39–43]. Carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and activated carbon (AC) have been commonly used as the catalyst supports due to their attractive physical and thermal properties such as high surface area (i.e., 180–200 m2 g�1 [44–47]), uniform and straight pores, inert graphitic surface, and high thermal stability, while also

2.2. Preparation of rGO Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized according to the modified Hummers method [58], with additional modifications following Sawangphruk et al. [59]. First, graphite powder (5.0 g) and NaNO3 (7.5 g) were mixed in H2SO4 (500 ml). Then, KMnO4 (40.0 g) was slowly added under stirring at 200 rpm in an ice bath for 24 h. Water (500 ml) and H2O2 (150 ml) were added into mixture solution in an ice bath under stirring at 200 rpm for 24 h. The product was collected by centrifuge and washed with water several times until the pH was neutral. The as-synthesized product was dried at 50 �C for 24 h. Next, rGO was prepared via a chemical reduction of GO. First, the as-prepared GO (1.0 g) was dispersed in 300 ml of water under sonication for 1 h. Then, hydrazine (30 ml) was added into the suspension while stirring at 200 rpm at 98 �C for 24 h to eliminate oxygen functional groups. Finally, the assynthesized product was collected via vacuum filtration and
